The few shot example English Answers were generated with ad-hoc GPT-4 queries like this:
The following is a JSON configuration for a pie chart visualization: {
     "graphType":"Pie",
     "pieSegmentLabels":"outside",
     "pieSegmentPrecision":"1",
     "pieSegmentSeparation":"2",
     "pieType":"solid"
  }. Generate a plain English text that accurately describes this JSON configuration. Do not use a numbered list of bullets, the generated text should be a sequence of sentences describing the configuration.

And then manually inspected and possibly edited.
